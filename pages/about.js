			<h1>Hey there! ðŸ‘‹</h1>
			<p>
				I'm a recent graduate from The University of Texas at Austin,
				currently living in Austin and looking for software engineering
				opportunities.
			</p>
			<p>
				During college, I worked as one of the first engineers at{" "}
				<a href="https://clean-em.com">Clean 'Em</a> where I helped
				design and build the first version of the web application. I
				ended up helping design and build the second version, as well as
				the first iOS application.
			</p>
			<p>
				I also worked as an IT technician for the department of{" "}
				<a href="https://utrecsports.org">Recreational Sports</a> in The
				University of Texas at Austin, where I helped maintain and
				create software and hardware.
			</p>
			<p>
				Prior to Clean 'Em, I had software engineering internships at{" "}
				<a href="https://gardenmaniaus.com">Gardenmania</a> where I
				helped build solutions for better client management, as well as
				did some freelance work to help put up new websites and improve
				their SEO.
